== Working with Rabbitmq as standalone process running alongside your Rails

The application focuses on subscribing to a set of events and updating databases and performing operations based on the incoming data.

Though this could be run the same way as the publisherapp it makes more sense to run it as a separate process from the API by launching a separate process which loads the Rails environment and keeps the reactor on the main thread.

Check <tt> script/rabbitmq.rb </tt>

Launch the admin console from <tt> http://localhost:15672/ </tt>
